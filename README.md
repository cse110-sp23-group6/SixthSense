## *Version 1.1*

Deployment: https://cse110-sp23-group6.github.io/SixthSense/

Documentation: https://github.com/cse110-sp23-group6/SixthSense/tree/main/jsdocs

New Features: 
- Sound Control: Users now have the ability to control the in-app sounds across the pages, customizing their journey even more. 
- Zodiac Emojis: Each user profile now comes with a matching zodiac emoji, representing the user's zodiac sign. 
- Deployment Bug Fix: Previous version does not deploy as intended to Github pages, bug fixed. 

Info: Version 1.0.0 serves as our major release, as we have fine tuned the functionalities of our project. New functionalities, such as the sound button, have been added based on feedback from real people testing the project. We hope to improve our code maintainability by removing the duplicate code. There are some minor bugs that we will aim to repair, but this is essentially our final product. 

## Version 1.0

New Features: 
- Share Button: Users now have the ability to take an in-app screen capture of their fortune and current emotion, which they can share via a link to their friends! 
- More Fortunes: Our project now offers even more readings for each category, so that users can explore greater possibilites. 
- Page Icon: Now there is cute SixthSense icon on our page! 

Info: Version 0.1.1 serves as our updated release, which has significant updates from the inital MVP version. The CI/CD Pipeline is both complete and functions with a linter, JSDocs (now stored in the [jsdocs](https://github.com/cse110-sp23-group6/SixthSense/tree/main/jsdocs) folder), Code Climate (tag displayed at the top of this file), and Minifier. The UI has been updated to be uniform across all pages and animations have been added. To view this version of the project, check out this [deployment](https://github.com/cse110-sp23-group6/SixthSense/actions/runs/5158284771) from the end of sprint 2 on Github pages.

## Version 0.1

Info: This first version servers as our MVP release, where the code is working and the major idea of our project is captured. The CI/CD Pipeline has a linter and JSDocs, but we still need to have the docs generate in an output folder rather than in a seperate branch. We also are looking to add Code Climate and a Minifier to our pipeline in time for the next release. Our site is deployed on Github Pages, but there are some minor navigation bugs that need fixing. We also intend to make minor upgrades the UI to make it more user-friendly. To view this version of the project, check out our [intial deployment](https://github.com/cse110-sp23-group6/SixthSense/actions/runs/5074121030) on Github pages.
